# StudentManagementSystem
The goal of the Student management system is to allow any organization's administrator to  modify and find out a student's personal information while also allowing the student to view their  profiles.

This project “Student Management System” acts as a frontier for maintenance of a student’s information. It can be used by educational institutions as extensive information is available at fingertips easily. The focus has been put on presenting the information in an easy and intelligible manner. 
The services of a student management system include:
	Adding student data
	Examination details
	Course details
	Attendance details
	Department details

It will also make it easier to keep track of everything like student’s details, such as their id, name, mailing address, and phone number, date of birth, and so on. As a result, all of a student's information will be available in one place. The project's major goal is to bring disparate parts of student’s details together in a uniform way so that complicated functions may be done efficiently by both technical and non-technical people.
The admin module is in charge of the system's dynamic operation. The admin module can be used to add new features and change essential settings.The user can register itself and view the details.
It is designed to be a stand-alone product that does not rely on other websites' availability. In addition, the system will have an administrator with full authority over all operations connected to the control and maintenance of the website. Overall, it will make Student Information Management easy for any organization's administrator and students.

Login module:
The authentication of user accounts will be aided by the login module. Only users with a valid login id and password are able to access their accounts.

Search module: 
Assume there are hundreds of students, and we need to find a specific student since we know his or her name. Even though we know the student's name, it is a time-consuming task in a manual system; however, utilising this module, we can quickly find the student by entering the student's name in the search criteria.

Registration Module and Account Management:
This module will make on-paper registration a lot easier. After completing the registration process, the admin can update information as needed.

User Management:
This module will assist the administrator in enabling and deleting user accounts, as well as updating user information as needed

The goal of this project is to keep track of student information, such as information about:
Student id
 Student password
 Student name
 Student DOB
 Student mailing address 
 Contact no
 City,etc
